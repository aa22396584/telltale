# What was verified on hardware, and what that is worth

The Android device used below is a Samsung `SM-S9280` on Android 16. Earlier
rounds were manual screen walks; the 2026-08-23 BLE run used Flutter's
integration-test driver on the same physical phone so a locked screen could not
turn UI automation into a false negative.

There is now one bounded purchased-adapter and real-vehicle observation. The
maintainer used the CARLZS LAB `CL-OBDII-M25B` over Bluetooth LE to connect
Telltale to a Toyota GT86. This does not retroactively turn the historical rig
rounds below into vehicle evidence, and it does not establish broad adapter or
GT86 compatibility. What each observation does and does not establish is the
point of this file; the [automated test evidence](test-evidence.md) covers the
suite.

Round 9 added a proxy in that socket that logs every byte and can hold a reply
back, which is how the timing findings were tested and how one of them was
found to have been testing nothing at all.

## The one line a machine reads

An entry carries the line below when a release build of that version was
installed on a phone and the screens the changelog names were exercised on it.
Most entries here are not that, and do not carry it. The 2026-09-06 round is
the near miss worth naming: it installed the 1.0.8 APK and got as far as a
failed connect, then says of itself "**Not** a field BLE/Classic/vehicle
pass". A line reading `Device walk attested: 1.0.8` above that paragraph would
be arguing with the paragraph. The gate reads the line; the entry is what a
person reads to decide whether the line was earned.

```
Device walk attested: <version>
```

`<version>` is a placeholder here on purpose, and it is not a stylistic choice.
This paragraph lives inside the file the gate scans, so an example written as a
real version **is** an attestation: with `Device walk attested: 1.0.12` in this
code block, deleting the entry below still cleared a full release of 1.0.12.
The documentation of the gate satisfied the gate.

A reviewer found that. The obvious regression test did not — it stripped every
`Device walk attested:` line and watched the gate refuse, which strips the
example along with the entry and so passes either way. What catches it is
counting: `test/release_notes_contract_test.dart` requires **one** attestation
per version, and a second copy of a version is something that is not an entry.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` refuses a full-release tag whose version has no
such line, before it builds anything. That is the whole of the gate: it does
not read the prose, and the prose is still what the entry is for.

It is a separate line rather than something parsed out of a heading because a
heading is a sentence, and sentences mention versions without attesting them.
`## 2026-09-07 — 1.0.11 walk; 1.0.12 not installed` cleared an earlier version
of this gate for 1.0.12 — a line that says the opposite of what it was read as
saying. A field takes a deliberate keystroke; a mention does not.

**The line attests the version, not the commit.** Nothing checks that the code
walked is byte-for-byte the code tagged, and the release notes say so rather
than implying otherwise. Neither does it attest the published APK: the walked
build is not signed with the community key, and CI's is.

Both gaps were raised as defects, and both are being kept rather than closed —
so the reason belongs here, not in a review thread. Binding the attestation to
a commit SHA sounds free and is not: the walk happens on a branch, before the
squash merge that creates the commit a tag can point at, so the SHA a
maintainer could write down is one that never reaches `main`. Binding it to the
published APK's digest needs a second workflow, a download, a commit and
another wait on every release — and it would prove the maintainer *downloaded*
the artifact, not that they walked it, which is what this file is for. A
weaker claim that is true beats a stronger one nobody can check, and the price
of keeping it is one sentence in the release notes saying which claim it is.

## 2026-09-11 — 1.0.14 release APK on Galaxy S24 Ultra (Pixel_9 installed)

Device walk attested: 1.0.14

Samsung `R5CX10VFFBA` (zh-TW) and emulator-5554 `Pixel_9` (APK installed;
the photographed walk is the S24 Ultra). Built `app-field-release.apk` from
`release/1.0.14` with `-PallowUnsignedRelease=true` so it could overlay the
debug-signed 1.0.13 already on the phone — uninstalling that install would
wipe `dataDir`, which this walk does not. **The walked binary is debug-signed
and is not the artifact CI or Play publishes**; the walk establishes
behaviour, not the release signature. emulator-5556 was not used.

`dumpsys package` after install, read from the package manager: both devices
`versionCode=15 versionName=1.0.14`. `logcat` on the phone pid: zero
`E/flutter`, zero `FATAL EXCEPTION`, zero `RenderFlex` / `MissingPluginException`.

Walked on the phone, changelog flows: language picker lists Deutsch beside
English, 繁體中文 and the system default, before any connection. Affiliate
line still 蝦皮 in zh-TW. Demo ECU live gauges (`Demo ECU (2.0L Turbo I4)`,
`AUTO, ISO 15765-4 (CAN 11/500)`, **批次讀取**, `72 PIDs/s`, `14.1 V`).
Fault codes: 3 codes, VIN `1D4GP00R55B123456`, freeze-frame cause `P0301`
so the Mode 02 gate was exercised, readiness monitors present. Settings
market sheet lists 美國（EPA） and 臺灣（經濟部能源署）. Taiwan picker
hedges that the year is a certification calendar year not a U.S. model year,
that namesakes are not EPA configurations, and that 參考車重 is not curb
mass. Applied `2023 HONDA CIVIC TOP-E · A1 · 5D` — provenance reads
`官方精確 1/8` / `MOEA Energy Administration` and `只會套用：排氣量`.

Connection-failure action on the phone: Wi-Fi to the default
`192.168.0.10:35000` (not on this LAN) rendered the unreachable-adapter
copy — 適配器可能太遠或沒有供電, named as a possible cause not a
confirmed finding — with 匯出紀錄 / 含十六進位. BLE scan ran and listed
nearby devices (WIN_DESKTOP and unnamed advertisements); that is a scan
that found something, not a scan-failure mapping. The nearby-devices
permission dialog was shown once. Radio-off, `BUS INIT`, adapter-up ECU
silence, and `0100` NO DATA were not staged on this phone; those mapper
rows remain widget-tested. No crash. No vehicle.

Harness: `integration_test/demo_rig_test.dart` PASS on `R5CX10VFFBA` and
on `emulator-5554`. `tool/telemetry_lifecycle_rig/run.sh` PASS on both.
`integration_test/wifi_rig_test.dart` PASS on `R5CX10VFFBA` against Ircama
on `192.168.1.109:35000` (phone `wlan0` `192.168.1.142/24`). BLE peripheral
rig not run — needs a second machine.

## 2026-09-11 — 1.0.13 release APK on Pixel_9 and Galaxy S24 Ultra

Device walk attested: 1.0.13

Samsung `R5CX10VFFBA` (zh-TW) and emulator-5554 `Pixel_9` (English). Built
`app-field-release.apk` from `feat/release-1.0.13` with
`-PallowUnsignedRelease=true` — this worktree has no `android/key.properties`,
so the Gradle guard would refuse a release build rather than sign with the
debug key. **The walked binary is debug-signed and is not the artifact CI or
Play publishes**; the walk establishes behaviour, not the release signature.
The previous Play-signed install on the phone had to be removed first for
that reason. emulator-5556 was not used.

`dumpsys package` after install, read from the package manager: both devices
`versionCode=14 versionName=1.0.13`. The process pid was unchanged from
launch through Demo, dashboard, a fault-code scan, Settings, disconnect and
a second Demo connect.

Walked: the language picker lists Deutsch beside English, 繁體中文 and the
system default, on both phones, before any connection. The affiliate line
reads Shopee in English and 蝦皮 in zh-TW. Demo ECU live gauges; the
dashboard shows **Batched polling** once Mode 01 packing is observed. Fault
codes: 3 codes, VIN `1D4GP00R55B123456`, freeze-frame cause `P0301` so the
Mode 02 gate was exercised. Settings connection card. No crash.

The Connect four-row handshake panel is not on screen long enough to
photograph on Demo — the dashboard replaces it before a screenshot. The
rows are covered by widget tests on this commit. No adapter, no vehicle.

Harness on Pixel_9: `integration_test/demo_rig_test.dart` PASS and
`tool/telemetry_lifecycle_rig/run.sh emulator-5554` PASS.

## 2026-09-07 — 1.0.12 release APK, English walk-through on the phone

Device walk attested: 1.0.12

Samsung `R5CX10VFFBA`. Built `app-field-release.apk` from `release/1.0.12` with
`-PallowUnsignedRelease=true` — the Gradle guard refuses a release build with no
`android/key.properties` rather than quietly signing with the debug key, and this
worktree has none. **So this binary is debug-signed and is not the artifact CI
publishes**; the walk establishes behaviour, not the release signature. The old
install had to be removed first for the same reason.

`dumpsys package` after install: `versionCode=13 versionName=1.0.12` — read from
the package manager, not from what `adb install` printed, because that command
has printed its own failure and exited 0 here before.

Walked in `Locale('en')`, chosen through the app's own picker on the connect
screen before any connection, VIN or permission — which is the reachability that
ImL1s/telltale#92's first acceptance line asks for. No crash; the pid was
unchanged from launch to the end of the walk.

English throughout, checked screen by screen: connect (including the affiliate
line, which now reads **Shopee** rather than 蝦皮 — ImL1s/telltale#103), Demo
simulator card and its description, dashboard with live gauges, Settings
(vehicle profile, `Petrol / Diesel / LPG` fuel picker, commission disclosure,
`View on Shopee`), fault codes (scan of the Demo ECU: 3 codes, VIN
`1D4GP00R55B123456`, a freeze frame whose cause code `P0301` was read — so the
Mode 02 gate was exercised, not bypassed — readiness monitors, and English code
descriptions), and the estimate details dialog, which is the one
ImL1s/telltale#101 fixed: it now reads `Mass 1500 kg (generic default); Cd 0.30
(generic default)…` where an English build used to render the exported
Traditional Chinese sentence.

Manual command box: `ATI` → `ELM327 v2.1`, and the panel chrome is English.

**One failure, and it is why this walk was worth doing.** Sending `2F1234` — a
write service the box refuses — renders, in the English build:

    不認得的指令「2F1234」。這裡只接受唯讀查詢（Mode 01/02/03/05/06/07/09/0A/22）
    與轉接器查詢指令。

That is `ObdSession.manualCommandRefusal`, which ImL1s/telltale#45 owns and which
is not in this release. ImL1s/telltale#102 localized the *adapter's* failures on
this panel, not the panel's own policy refusals. The changelog for 1.0.12 had
been written from the diff and claimed the box was fixed; the phone is what said
otherwise, and the changelog now names this as still Chinese rather than
implying it was fixed.

**What this does not establish.** No adapter, no vehicle, no Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
transport — the whole walk ran on the in-app Demo simulator, which is an object
inside the process and never touches a socket. It says the English strings reach
the screens; it says nothing about the protocol layer that the rigs and the one
GT86 observation cover.

## 2026-09-06 — 1.0.8 release APK, OBDBLE still unpowered

Samsung `R5CX10VFFBA`: installed Play-upload-key `app-field-release.apk`
(`com.cbstudio.telltale` 1.0.8 / versionCode 9). Connect screen remembered
**OBDBLE** (`Bluetooth LE · AA:BB:CC:11:22:33`). Tap 直接連線 → app copy
`無法連線到 OBDBLE。請確認轉接器已通電且在範圍內。` `dumpsys bluetooth_manager`
still `ACL BR/EDR:N LE:N`. **Not** a field BLE/Classic/vehicle pass. When the
dongle is powered, `cd app && tool/field_bt_verify/run.sh`.

## 2026-09-01 — OBDBLE ACL recheck + field_bt_verify harness

Samsung `R5CX10VFFBA`: Bluetooth adapter **ON**, bonded **OBDBLE** /
**OBDII (SPP)** still present, but `ConnectionState: STATE_DISCONNECTED` and
the bonded line reports `ACL BR/EDR:N LE:N`. Fresh harness probe:
`field-bt-probe-20260831T235526Z.txt` (prior same-day
`obdble-acl-recheck-*.txt` reached the same verdict). Mac
`system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType` shows no OBD-like peripheral.
**No** app-level connect attempted — nothing was advertising; ACL stayed down.
**No** fresh field BLE or Classic journey this session — do not treat as a pass.

When the dongle is powered, the one-command gate is:

```bash
cd app && tool/field_bt_verify/run.sh
```

See `tool/field_bt_verify/README.md`. ACL-down is an observation, not a
refused field pass. A field PASS still requires a fresh connect → live PIDs
→ short record from `integration_test/field_bt_journey_test.dart` (field
flavor) in this run. `--probe-only` never prints that PASS.

## 2026-09-01 — OBDBLE ACL recheck (still unpowered)

Samsung `R5CX10VFFBA`: Bluetooth adapter **ON**, bonded **OBDBLE** /
**OBDII (SPP)** still present, but `ConnectionState: STATE_DISCONNECTED` and
the bonded line reports `ACL BR/EDR:N LE:N`. Evidence:
`obdble-acl-recheck-20260831T222101Z.txt` (prior same-day
`obdble-acl-recheck-20260831T212448Z.txt` reached the same verdict). **No**
fresh field BLE or Classic journey this session — do not treat as a pass.

## 2026-08-30 — telemetry-v1 evidence snapshot

This section reports only terminal artifacts present in the current
`.omx/evidence/telemetry-v1/` bundle. It does not erase the dated historical
runs below, but it prevents an older pass from being mistaken for a pass of the
current tree.

### Host/software

- The project-owned freeze-frame oracle reports `passed=7 skipped=0 failed=0`.
- Direct Ircama reports `passed=6 skipped=0 failed=0`.
- The nominal fragmentation proxy reports `passed=6 skipped=0 failed=0`, with
  136 commands, 1,506 chunks, and a maximum chunk size of five bytes.
- Fresh close, missing-prompt, and critical-reply-corruption proxy processes
  each report `passed=1 skipped=0 failed=0` at their expected command boundary.

These are socket/protocol/software results. They do not involve the Samsung
phone, Bluetooth, a purchased adapter, an ECU, or a vehicle.

### Samsung `SM-S9280`

- `device/demo/flutter-final.log` ends `All tests passed!` after app-ready,
  live polling, lifecycle callback recovery, recording, History, replay,
  disconnected export capture, and deletion/privacy assertions. This is a
  shipped-app UI/storage journey driven by Demo data. It uses no socket or
  radio.
- `device/classic/flutter-final.log` ends `All tests passed!`. This crosses the
  Flutter method/event-channel boundary and serial bytes through the rig's
  simulated RFCOMM path. The native Classic boundary is mocked, so this is not
  `BluetoothSocket`, RFCOMM-radio, adapter, ECU, or vehicle evidence.
- `device/ble/flutter-final.log` ends `All tests passed!`. The paired bridge log
  records real central writes and notification replies, including a post-resume
  `ATRV` response followed by additional PID traffic. The app-side test also
  requires persisted simulated-rig provenance, selected Nordic UART/CCCD
  metadata, telemetry recording/export, and transcript evidence that the
  resume probe occurred. This is a physical-phone-to-Mac BLE/GATT pass against
  a synthetic peripheral/ECU, not a purchased-adapter or vehicle pass.
- `device/wifi/nominal/flutter-final.log` ends `All tests passed!` after the
  test-only TextField target was corrected. The Samsung used actual LAN TCP to
  the Mac fragmentation proxy and Ircama synthetic ELM/ECU. The paired proxy
  log records 65 commands, zero injected faults, and two phone connections,
  including the resume path. This is nominal phone/network/software-ECU
  evidence; it is not a purchased Wi-Fi adapter/hotspot, cellular-handoff,
  physical ECU, or vehicle test. Deterministic close, missing-prompt, and
  corruption control exists on the host, but those post-first-value chaos modes
  have not yet run on the device in this snapshot.

No 2026-08-30 artifact in this bundle uses the purchased adapter or GT86. The
only real-adapter/real-vehicle evidence remains the bounded 2026-08-27
observation below; it cannot establish another adapter unit, another GT86, or
any other make/model.

### Telemetry lifecycle and memory/share gates

The lifecycle runner is designed to use an actual Android Home event and
`am force-stop`, then compare the killed durable prefix with fresh-process
recovery and root History UI. The memory runner is designed to measure PSS and
exercise production streaming/share sources. Neither has a fresh terminal
device log in the current telemetry-v1 bundle, so runner code and readiness
markers are not reported as device passes.

Revision-8 Gate C also remains explicitly incomplete. There is no deterministic
production pause seam at the verified-source-to-handoff cut or the
durable-handoff-to-platform cut, not every UI share entry exposes a common
controller seam, and the real chooser/plugin mirror cannot be made
deterministic by the injected measured platform. See
[`tool/telemetry_memory_rig/GATE_C_BLOCKERS.md`](../../tool/telemetry_memory_rig/GATE_C_BLOCKERS.md).

## 2026-08-27 — purchased BLE adapter on a Toyota GT86

The maintainer identified the vehicle as a Toyota GT86 and the purchased
adapter as a CARLZS LAB `CL-OBDII-M25B` (NCC `CCAH22LP5300T8`). On 2026-08-29,
a fresh inspection of the same Samsung `SM-S9280` found:

- Telltale `1.0.4+5` still installed with the remembered adapter `OBDBLE`;
- Bluetooth LE recorded as the last transport; and
- a 418,028-byte recovered Telltale session dated 2026-08-27 13:36.

The vehicle identity and fact of the GT86 connection come from the maintainer's
direct field report. The retained phone state independently confirms the exact
app, phone, adapter label, transport, date, and existence of a substantial
session record. The identifier-bearing export was recovered and reviewed only
in a private local workspace; it is not committed or published.

The approximately 22-minute export provides these bounded additional facts:

- the adapter reported `ELM327 v1.5` and CAN 11-bit/500 kbit/s; retained,
  uncalibrated `ATRV` replies ranged from 14.0 to 14.3 V;
- retained stationary-idle replies included successful single- and multi-PID
  polling with no `NO DATA`, CAN/BUS errors, timeouts, or malformed replies;
- actual notification/framing shapes included a stray `0xFC` reset byte,
  chained support masks, split prompt delivery, `7F 01 12`, and a numbered
  three-segment batch; a de-identified synthetic regression preserves those
  shapes; and
- 12,953 middle entries were dropped by the old transcript capacity policy.
  The surviving head and tail cannot establish continuity or what happened in
  that missing interval.

This closes the earlier blanket gap of “no purchased adapter and no vehicle”
for **this one connection**. It does not establish the GT86 model year, ECU
calibration, adapter identity replies, PID accuracy, DTC coverage, sustained
polling across the missing interval, road-load behaviour, disconnect cause,
crank behavior, or compatibility with another unit or listing revision. See
the [hardware compatibility notes](../hardware-compatibility.md) for the public
purchase-link and affiliate-disclosure boundary, and the
[rig matrix](rig-matrix.md) for the full evidence ladder.

## 2026-08-29 — cross-vehicle profile isolation and rig refresh

Vehicle mass, drivetrain loss, displacement, volumetric efficiency and fuel
assumptions are now trusted only after explicit confirmation during the current
connection. A disconnect, link loss or new connection invalidates that trust;
saved values may prefill the form but cannot silently carry horsepower, torque
or estimated-fuel calculations from one vehicle to another. Direct ECU values,
including Mode 01 PID `015E` when a controller actually supplies it, remain
visible as measured data.

Fresh validation on the final local tree recorded:

- `flutter analyze`: clean; ordinary `flutter test`: 955 passed and 13 expected
  external-oracle skips;
- all skipped oracle cases separately required and executed: seven project-owned
  freeze-frame cases, five direct Ircama cases, five fragmented-Ircama cases,
  plus close, missing-prompt and corrupted-reply fault cases — zero skips and
  zero failures;
- 56 BLE-rig controller tests and 13 TCP-chaos tests passed;
- on the Samsung `SM-S9280` / Android 16, the Demo, Classic plugin-boundary,
  Android TCP loopback and physical Samsung-to-Mac BLE/GATT rigs each passed;
  the BLE evidence included real scan, connect, service discovery, subscribe,
  write and notification traffic; and
- the `field` debug APK assembled successfully.

This is evidence that unknown or newly connected vehicles fail closed instead
of inheriting profile-derived numbers. It is **not** evidence that every vehicle
or adapter was physically tested. No legacy-bus vehicle, 29-bit CAN vehicle, or
identified commercial OBD simulator was available for this run; those gaps
remain explicit in the rig matrix.

## 2026-08-23 — physical Samsung-to-Mac BLE/GATT rig

The isolated `com.cbstudio.telltale.rig` build ran on the Samsung phone while a
second machine advertised `TelltaleELM` through CoreBluetooth. The test found
the named result, scrolled its actionable tile into the phone's viewport,
tapped it, and completed the real Android GATT path:

- native `BluetoothGatt` connect and connection-state success;
- MTU handling and Nordic UART service/characteristic discovery;
- CCCD notification subscription;
- ELM327 initialization, `0100` capability probes, live PID polling, and
  `ATRV` traffic crossing real BLE writes and notifications;
- a persisted transcript explicitly labelled as simulated rig evidence; and
- polling recovery after injected Dart lifecycle pause/resume callbacks.

The exact driver command was:

```bash
flutter test integration_test/ble_rig_test.dart -d <device-id> \
  --flavor rig --dart-define=TELLTALE_TEST_RIG=true
```

It ended `All tests passed`. The host bridge recorded one subscription, 36
central writes, and 58 notification chunks; Android logcat independently showed
the GATT connection, MTU, service discovery, and UART service selection.

This is **physical phone + physical BLE radios + real GATT**, but the peripheral
and ECU conversation in this 2026-08-23 run are still test infrastructure. At
that time it did not establish the purchased adapter's firmware/profile/timing,
Bluetooth Classic, an
indicate-only adapter, a real ECU/CAN response, ignition/crank behavior, Android
Doze delivery, or any vehicle result. The lifecycle callbacks were injected by
the test, not delivered by the operating system.

## 2026-08-23 — host-only rig hardening (not new device evidence)

This continuation had no physical Android device attached, so none of the
historical phone results below was revalidated. An Android emulator was later
attached for an isolated Wi-Fi rig run; it is not radio or phone evidence.

- Ircama ran on loopback behind the TCP chaos proxy. The five existing oracle
  tests completed through deterministic fragmentation, and separate fresh
  proxy processes made connection-close, missing-prompt, and corruption faults
  fail at the intended initialization command.
- The CoreBluetooth bridge completed three consecutive start/status/stop
  cycles, a natural-expiry cycle, and a custom-`TMPDIR` cycle, leaving no
  listener or owned process. The tests exposed a transient readiness race,
  LaunchServices access stalls for scripts under `Documents`, and a changing
  TCC code identity when the host bundle followed `TMPDIR`; the controller now
  retries its complete status snapshot, stages scripts privately, and keeps a
  stable host identity. Its same-Mac scan remained the expected negative
  control.
- The Android emulator's real TCP stack connected through `adb reverse`,
  reached live polling, persisted simulated evidence, and recovered after a
  lifecycle pause. The rig package was isolated and removed by the Flutter
  integration-test runner afterward.
- Rig logs were created owner-only, and the Android rig package/evidence paths
  are isolated and explicitly marked as simulated.

This host-only continuation proved orchestration and real TCP behavior. At that
round it did **not** prove an Android permission flow, a second-device GATT
connection, the purchased adapter's firmware or Bluetooth profile, an ECU
response, or any vehicle behavior; those were still separate physical gates.

## The three links exercised

| | What it is |
|---|---|
| Demo simulator | The in-app `DemoTransport`. Every screen, no hardware. |
| **Wi-Fi → `Ircama/ELM327-emulator`** | The phone's real `WifiTransport` opening a real TCP socket to an ELM327 implementation nobody here wrote, reached over `adb reverse tcp:35000 tcp:35000`. Protocol handshake, framing, timing and error paths are all its, not ours. |
| **BLE → CoreBluetooth rig → Ircama** | A physical Samsung phone crossing real BLE radios, Android GATT, Nordic UART discovery/subscription, writes and notifications. The peripheral host and ECU remain simulated. |

In these pre-purchase rounds, Bluetooth Classic and purchased-adapter behavior
were exercised only as far as an absent adapter allowed. The BLE rig went
further, but remained a rig.

## Verified over the Wi-Fi link

This is the part that resembles a car.

- **Handshake and protocol detection.** `127.0.0.1:35000`, reported as
  `AUTO, ISO 15765-4 (CAN 11/500)` — read from the adapter, not assumed.
- **Live telemetry**: 9–10 PIDs/s, all six gauges reading, `13.7 V` from a real
  `ATRV`.
- **Fast mode correctly *off*.** The status strip showed 單筆模式. The app
  established that batching was not available and fell back rather than
  producing mis-split frames — the failure round 6 was spent preventing.
- **VIN read**: `MAT403096BNL00000`.
- **The headline case.** The emulator does not answer Mode 03/07/0A. The screen
  said:

  > **無法確認** — 車輛沒有回應 Mode 03 查詢，因此無法確認是否有已儲存的故障碼。
  > **這與「沒有故障碼」不是同一件事。**

  and for the optional classes, that it could not tell "the vehicle does not
  support this" from "this connection did not read it". A green
  未偵測到故障碼 here would have been the defect this entire review loop is
  about, produced against a real protocol implementation rather than a fixture.
- **The clear button was absent**, because no result had been established. You
  cannot clear what could not be read.

## Round 9, with the wire visible

Round 9 changed the connection itself — one new command, a lease on every
write, a deadline on every write — so this round was run with a logging TCP
proxy between the phone and the emulator, and with the proxy able to *hold*
a reply back. That turns it from a fixture into a controllable slow ECU, which
is what the lifecycle findings needed and what no unit test can supply.

### `AT PPS`, against an implementation nobody here wrote

Two decisions had no source but a guess: whether protocol `B`/`C` is even a
framed bus (PP 2C / 2E), and whether the adapter handles Response Pending
(PP 2A bit 2). Adding a command to a connection is the riskiest change this
app can make, so the wire log is the evidence:

```
>> b'ATDPN\r'
<< b'A6\r\r>'
>> b'ATPPS\r'
<< b'00:FF F 01:FF F 02:FF F 03:32 F\r … \r2C:E0 F 2D:04 F 2E:80 F 2F:0A F\r\r>'
>> b'ATRV\r'
```

- **It is after the handshake, not inside it.** `ATPPS` appears between
  `ATDPN` and the first poll, exactly as designed — a refusal there cannot
  fail a connection.
- **The format matches the datasheet**, so the parser written from it reads a
  third party's output without adjustment.
- **`2A:38 F` is the trap, present in the wild.** The stored value has bit 2
  *cleared*; the state letter says the parameter is **off**, so what governs is
  the factory default `3C` — bit 2 **set**. A parser that reads the value and
  ignores the letter concludes the opposite of the truth on this very adapter.
  That reading comes from the datasheet's worked example (p.67: "it is enabled
  (oN), while the others are all off") and was flagged as the blocking risk
  before the parser was written.
- `2C:E0` / `2E:80` match the documented defaults, so B and C resolve to *no
  data formatting* — which is why mapping them to ISO 15765-4 was wrong.

### An interrupted scan, with a controller that was genuinely still working

The first attempt at this proved nothing and looked like it had. The emulator
answers `03`/`07`/`0A` immediately, so the whole scan finished in **0.03 s** —
before the app could be backgrounded at all. The timestamps said so; the
screen did not.

With the proxy holding Mode 03 for four seconds, both halves are real:

| | outcome |
|---|---|
| **Control** — 4 s hold, no interruption | Scan completes, correct qualified verdict, connection survives |
| **Interrupted** — same hold, Home at +1.5 s, back at +3 s | 讀取失敗 — 掃描在中途被中斷…請重新掃描 |

and the wire agrees: after the held `03` there is no `07`, no `0A`, no `0902`.
The scan stopped, the previous verdict was discarded rather than left standing,
and the screen says why. The difference between the two rows is the
interruption, not the slowness — which is the pair round 9's H-03 needed.

A nine-second hold instead tears the link down with 轉接器停止回應, which is
correct: past the seven-second global window with no `7F xx 78`, silence is a
dead adapter, and the datasheet says a conforming one would have answered
`NO DATA` long before.

### The headline case, still intact

`無法確認 — 車輛沒有回應 Mode 03 查詢…這與「沒有故障碼」不是同一件事。`
VIN read on the same scan. The clear button absent, because nothing was
established. All of round 9's lease and deadline threading passes through this
path and none of it broke the verdict.

### The clear, which is the only command that changes the vehicle

`clearDtcs` was reworked twice today — C-04 gave it a per-write lease, C-03
gave it a fallback to the controllers the preceding scan heard, plus a new
refusal when coverage is unknown. It is also the one path the Wi-Fi walk
structurally cannot reach: the emulator answers nothing, so no result is
established, so the button correctly never appears. It was pressed on the demo
link instead, which is the only link that can.

- Scan: three codes, each attributed to controller `7E8`, plus a VIN.
- 清除 offered, and its dialog says what it costs — readiness monitors reset,
  a full drive cycle needed before the vehicle can pass inspection, permanent
  Mode 0A codes not clearable.
- Confirmed, and the auto-rescan came back green:

  > **已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼。**
  > 這代表每個回覆的控制器都回報無故障碼，不代表車上每個模組都已被問到。

That green is the point. C-03 added a refusal for the case where coverage
cannot be established, and this is the case where it *can* — one controller,
censused, acknowledged. Had the new rule been a shade too strict it would have
refused a clear the vehicle plainly performed, which is the over-strictness
round 6 was spent undoing. It did not.

### Re-walked after round 10

Round 10 changed the connection again — the response-pending, protocol-search
and write timers clamped to the caller's budget, the connect-time census
bounded, `B`/`C` resolved from an
observed identifier width when `AT PPS` is unavailable, the `ATH0` restore
given a real exemption, and the clear given the bus refusal its siblings had.
The walk above was repeated on that build:

- Wi-Fi handshake unchanged in shape — `ATPPS` still sits between `ATDPN` and
  the first poll — with six gauges live at 8 PIDs/s and `13.7 V`.

An earlier draft of this section claimed *every* rearm was clamped. It was not:
the one that runs on resume was missed, which round 11 found and fixed. The
sentence has been narrowed to what the walked build actually did.
- The headline fault-code case still reads 這與「沒有故障碼」不是同一件事.
- Demo link: scan, 清除, auto-rescan, back to
  已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼, and `logcat` clean of Flutter errors.

### Two features that had been opened but never used

Both were reachable only on the demo link, and both had been walked as far as
their first screen and no further — which is not the same as having been used.

- **The acceleration timer completed a run.** Every previous walk armed it and
  watched it correctly refuse while the car was moving; none had let it finish.
  Target 50 km/h, waited for the simulated car to come to a stop, armed, and
  it recorded **完成 0 → 50 km/h — 3.4 秒** with a speed trace showing the
  climb against the target line.
- **Delete, from the PID editor.** The trash icon had never been pressed on a
  device. A custom PID was created, enabled, opened and deleted: the counts
  went 已啟用 8 → 7 and 共 27 → 26, the manager came back with 沒有符合的 PID,
  and the dashboard did *not* repopulate with the shipped layout — which is
  round 10's R10-08 behaving correctly on hardware rather than only in a test.

The dashboard on this link also runs **fastMode** at 88 PIDs/s, which the
Wi-Fi link cannot show: the emulator does not support batching, and the app
correctly falls back to 單筆模式 there. Both branches of that decision have now
been seen on a device.

`logcat` clean of Flutter errors throughout.

### Re-walked after round 11

Round 11 replaced the user-CAN mechanism entirely — a slot whose framing was
demonstrated now installs *nothing*, rather than having its identifier width
guessed from a reply — and changed the pending filter, two timer paths and the
editor's save. Both links were walked again on that build:

- Wi-Fi: handshake, telemetry, and the fault-code screen still reading
  無法確認 … 這與「沒有故障碼」不是同一件事 with the VIN alongside it.
- Demo: scan → 清除 → auto-rescan → 已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼.
- `logcat` clean of Flutter errors on both.

### Re-walked after round 12

Round 12 removed the user-CAN promotion outright and narrowed fault-code
coverage back to fault-code evidence, so the connection behaves differently
again. Both links walked on that build: Wi-Fi handshake, telemetry and the
qualified 無法確認 verdict; demo scan → 清除 → auto-rescan →
已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼. `logcat` clean of Flutter errors on both.

### Re-walked after round 13

Round 13 made `supportsObd2` the single bus gate for every consumer — including
the poll loop, which had refused only J1939 — so the risk was refusing a bus
that works. Both links walked: Wi-Fi at 9 PIDs/s with six gauges live and the
qualified 無法確認 verdict, demo scan → 清除 → auto-rescan →
已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼. `logcat` clean on both.

### Re-walked after round 14

The identity extractor now reads every line and picks its pattern from the
bus's header width, which is a change to how *every* headered reply is read —
so both links were walked again. Wi-Fi: handshake, telemetry, VIN
`MAT403096BNL00000` and the qualified 無法確認 verdict. Demo: scan → 清除 →
auto-rescan → 已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼. `logcat` clean of Flutter errors on
both.

### Re-walked after round 15

Round 15 changed how every legacy reply is read — the trailing checksum is no
longer payload — and tightened where identity may come from. Both links walked
on that build: Wi-Fi handshake, telemetry and the qualified 無法確認 verdict;
demo scan → 清除 → auto-rescan → 已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼. `logcat` clean of
Flutter errors on both.

The legacy change is the one this walkthrough *could not* cover: at that round
there was no legacy vehicle/adapter pairing, so J1850 / ISO 9141 / KWP remained
fixtures. What changed is that those fixtures now carry the checksum the
datasheet says `ATH1` prints, which they did not before — so the code and the
fixtures agree with the document rather than with each other.

### Re-walked after round 16

Round 16 added checksum *validation* to every legacy reply and tightened the
CAN parser to the resolved width — both changes to how replies are accepted at
all, so a mistake here refuses working traffic rather than misreading it. Both
links walked: Wi-Fi handshake, telemetry and the qualified 無法確認 verdict;
demo scan → 清除 → auto-rescan → 已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼. `logcat` clean of
Flutter errors on both.

### Re-walked after round 17, and a gauge going dark on purpose

Round 17 tightened what the census will accept as a responder and loosened
which receive width a user slot may answer on — one refuses more, one refuses
less — so both links were walked again. Wi-Fi handshake, telemetry and the
qualified 無法確認 verdict; demo scan → 清除 → auto-rescan →
已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼. `logcat` clean on both.

One screenshot showed the LOAD gauge reading `--` with 匯流排錯誤 while the
other five read normally, which looked like a regression and was not. The wire
log settles it: the emulator answered `NO DATA` to `0104` four times across the
session, and the gauge recovered to 41.2% once the replies came back.

That is the designed behaviour seen on a real link, and it is worth recording
as such: a PID that stops answering goes dark and says why, rather than
holding the last plausible number it had. The failure this app is built around
is a wrong reading nobody can identify as wrong; a blank tile with a reason on
it is the opposite of that.

### Re-walked after round 18

Round 18 changed what counts as a controller — identifiers are range-checked at
their width, and a fault-code read may no longer establish its own coverage
from a source it discovered while being judged. Both are refusals, so the risk
is turning away a vehicle that works. Both links walked: Wi-Fi handshake,
telemetry, VIN and the qualified 無法確認 verdict; demo scan → 清除 →
auto-rescan → 已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼. `logcat` clean on both.

### Re-walked after round 19

Round 19 changed what the fault-code screen is allowed to *say* — `NO DATA` no
longer claims a category is unsupported or that no fault exists — as well as
which controllers count as having answered. Both links walked: Wi-Fi handshake,
telemetry, VIN `MAT403096BNL00000`, and all three categories reading 無法確認
with the honest "Mode 03 was silent too, so this cannot be told apart" wording.
Demo scan → 清除 → auto-rescan → 已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼. `logcat` clean on
both.

### Re-walked after round 20

Round 20 changed how a reply the adapter marked as damaged is treated: it is
still not data, and the controllers identifiable in it are no longer forgotten.
Both links walked: Wi-Fi handshake, telemetry, VIN and the three qualified
categories; demo scan → 清除 → auto-rescan → 已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼.
`logcat` clean on both.

### Re-walked after round 21

Round 21 added a refusal the clear did not have before — an exchange that
discarded an unresolvable address token marks coverage uncertain, and a clear
will not claim success against it. A refusal is the thing most likely to turn
away a working vehicle, so the clear was the point of this walk. Both links:
Wi-Fi handshake, telemetry and the three qualified categories; demo scan →
清除 → auto-rescan → 已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼. `logcat` clean on both.

### A defect the suite could not have found

Editing a custom PID's mode from `012F` to `0105` and tapping 儲存 did
nothing — no error, no message, the editor simply stayed open and the edit was
gone. `CircularDependencyError` in logcat, out of `PidRegistry.removeCustom`,
which `_save` reaches **only when the edit changes `Pid.id`**. Renaming saves
fine; correcting a mistyped mode does not.

Both editor regression tests written this round — one for Codex's L-02, one
for M-02 — change a name or a header that normalises back to what was stored.
Neither changes the identity. Two tests for two reviewers' findings, both
covering the half that could not break.

Fixed, and the reproduction now runs in the suite. On the device afterwards:
the save closes the editor, logcat is clean, and the definition polls.

### Also walked, on this build

- Custom PID created with the **header field deliberately cleared** — reopening
  the editor shows `7E0`, not blank, and once pointed at a supported PID it
  reads `62.0` live. That is round 9's M-02 end to end: blank → app default →
  transmitted → a real number. Stored as `''` it would have been silently
  marked unsupported, indistinguishable on screen from a car without the
  sensor.
- Six gauges live at 9–10 PIDs/s, `13.4 V` from a real `ATRV`, fast mode
  correctly off.
- 27 definitions in the PID manager, live values per row, search, filter.
  `Fuel Tank Level 012F` and `Fuel Pressure 010A` marked 不支援 while the
  supported ones read — the app declining to invent numbers for PIDs this
  vehicle does not have.
- Performance timer refusing to arm: 「請先完全停車 — 目前 14 km/h」.
- Light theme on a live link, then **1.6× text on top of it**: the dashboard
  reflows to one column, the status chips wrap to three rows, and the fault
  screen's long explanations wrap intact — including the sentence this whole
  review round is about.

## Round 23, after the typed-evidence rewrite

Galaxy S24 Ultra, debug build of `685d34a`, the ELM327 emulator over Wi-Fi on
one pass and the demo link on the other. The commit rewrote how a damaged
exchange decides who was on the bus, so both links were walked end to end
rather than spot-checked.

**Over the emulator.** Connected on `127.0.0.1:35000`, protocol negotiated to
`AUTO, ISO 15765-4 (CAN 11/500)`, six gauges live at 8 PIDs/s on `13.0 V`.
The VIN read whole — `MAT403096BNL00000`, a multi-frame Mode 09 reassembled
correctly.

Then the part worth having. This emulator answers `03` with `7E8 02 41 00` —
a **Mode 01 reply to a Mode 03 request**, which is exactly the stale-reply
case the last four rounds of review have been about. The scan reported:

> 無法確認 — 車輛沒有回應 Mode 03 查詢，因此無法確認是否有已儲存的故障碼。
> 這與「沒有故障碼」不是同一件事。

and the same for 07 and 0A, with no clear button offered. No false all-clear,
no controller invented from the reply, and the distinction between "silent"
and "clean" held on a real ELM327 protocol implementation over a real socket
rather than in a fixture.

**Over the demo link.** 75 PIDs/s with fastMode. Three stored codes — P0301,
P0420, U0123 — each attributed to controller `7E8`, VIN `1D4GP00R55B123456`.
清除 → 確定清除 → the automatic rescan came back
「已回應的控制器都沒有故障碼。」with its own caveat that this is not a
statement about every module on the car.

**Custom PID, created edited and deleted on the device.** `010B`, formula `A`,
unit kPa: saved (26 → 27 definitions), enabled, and immediately polling at
`108 kPa`. Edited to `A/2` from the same screen — the route carried the right
definition, the registry updated with no `CircularDependencyError`, and the
live value halved to `40.5 kPa`. Deleted, back to 26, no crash.

**Acceleration timer**, armed at rest and completed: `0 → 50 km/h 3.4 秒`,
with the speed trace drawn.

**Dark theme** on a live link, then **1.6× device font scale** on top of it:
the dashboard reflows to one gauge per row, the status chips wrap to two rows,
and the fault screen's explanations wrap intact.

`logcat` carried no `E/flutter` and no `FATAL EXCEPTION` across the whole
session.

## Round 23 final, after four reviewers

Same device, debug build of the last round-23 commit. Repeated because the
round changed the reply parser, the demo transport's rendering and the app's
lifecycle handling, so nothing from the earlier walk carried over.

The most useful thing about this pass is what the demo link now *is*. Round 23
made `DemoTransport` honour `ATS0` — it had acknowledged the command and gone
on printing spaces, the same answered-OK-did-nothing pattern this project
refuses from clones. So every reply on the demo link now arrives unspaced,
which is the rendering where a CAN header and its first payload byte run
together and the parser has to tell two readings of the same characters apart.
That path had never been exercised outside fixtures, and the whole of this
round's `_canLine` ranking work exists for it.

**Over the emulator**, unchanged and still correct: `AUTO, ISO 15765-4 (CAN
11/500)`, six gauges at 10 PIDs/s on `13.6 V`, VIN `MAT403096BNL00000`, and
all three fault-code categories reporting 無法確認 against an emulator that
answers Mode 03 with a Mode 01 reply. No clear offered.

**Over the demo link**, at 81 PIDs/s with fastMode and every byte unspaced:
P0301, P0420 and U0123 decoded and attributed to `7E8`, VIN
`1D4GP00R55B123456`. 清除 → the confirmation dialog carried the base warning
and *not* the new incomplete-coverage sentence, which is right — this scan
answered all three categories. The automatic rescan came back
「已回應的控制器沒有故障碼」 in the header, the qualified wording that replaced an
unqualified 未偵測到故障碼 this round.

Also live on the device: Mode 01 PID 01 is now read on every scan and agreed
with Mode 03 both before the clear (lamp on, three codes) and after it (lamp
off, none) — the simulator answering that PID from the same fault list it
serves, so the cross-check has something honest to check against.

Acceleration timer completed `0 → 50 km/h 4.1 秒` with its trace. PID manager
live at 26 definitions. `logcat` carried no `E/flutter` and no
`FATAL EXCEPTION` across the session, and three consecutive full-suite runs at
this commit were 498/498 — one reviewer had reported order-dependent flakiness
and none was reproducible here.

## The release build, at round 23's final commit

Every walk above this line used a debug build, which keeps everything R8 might
remove — so "debug works" is not evidence that the artefact a user would
install works. This one is the signed release APK of `4b8307e`: R8 shrinking
on, icon fonts tree-shaken from 1.9 MB to 7.7 KB, 57.2 MB packaged, signed
with the release key (`CN=Torque OBD2, OU=Development, O=ImL1s, L=Taipei,
C=TW` — the keystore is not in version control and `android/.gitignore`
excludes `key.properties` and `*.jks`; only `key.properties.example` is
tracked).

Installed over a full uninstall, so it also exercised first-run state rather
than inheriting the debug build's preferences.

- **The failure path first, unintentionally and usefully.** A fresh install
  defaults the Wi-Fi host to `192.168.0.10`, so the first attempt failed and
  rendered 「無法連線到 192.168.0.10:35000。請確認手機已連上轉接器的 Wi-Fi
  熱點。」 with the form reopened underneath it. The error path survives R8.
- **Wi-Fi to the ELM327 emulator**: connected, `AUTO, ISO 15765-4 (CAN
  11/500)`, gauges live at 9 PIDs/s on `13.6 V`, VIN read whole. All three
  fault-code categories 無法確認, as they must be against an emulator that
  answers Mode 03 with a Mode 01 reply.
- **A PID faulting mid-session**, which is worth recording: LOAD dropped to
  `--` with 匯流排錯誤 beside it rather than holding its last plausible
  number. That is the rule about frozen gauges, seen happening.
- **Demo**: 81 PIDs/s with fastMode, three codes attributed to `7E8`, 清除 →
  auto-rescan → 「已回應的控制器沒有故障碼」.
- `logcat` carried no `E/flutter`, no `FATAL EXCEPTION`, and — the ones that
  matter for a shrunk build — no `ClassNotFoundException`, `NoSuchMethodError`
  or `MissingPluginException`.

## Verified over Bluetooth in the pre-adapter round

More than anticipated, because the *failure* path exercises nearly everything
the success path would.

- **Classic device enumeration** lists the phone's actual paired devices with
  their addresses — six of them, none an ELM327. The screen says so plainly:
  headsets and speakers appear too, the adapter-looking ones are sorted first,
  and picking wrong costs about half a minute.
- **The full three-tier cascade, run against a device that is not an adapter.**
  Secure SDP, then insecure SDP, then explicit channel 1. It took about 45
  seconds — three tiers at their timeout — and ended with a specific message
  naming the device, with the app in a usable state and the list intact.

  That timing is the evidence. The cascade only advances because
  `connect(timeout:)` calls `cancelConnect`, which closes the socket and
  releases the native thread blocked inside `BluetoothSocket.connect()`. Had
  today's fork changes broken that, tier two would have raced tier one for an
  adapter that accepts a single link, and this would have hung rather than
  failing in three bounded steps. The one part of the fork work that seemed
  impossible to check without hardware is checked by its absence.
- **BLE scanning** runs and returns real nearby devices. Permissions granted,
  scan started, results rendered.

In that round neither transport completed a session, because there was no
adapter available.

## Verified through the UI on the demo link

- **Connect** → dashboard, 78 PIDs/s, fastMode open, six gauges.
- **Fault codes**: three codes, each attributed to controller `7E8`, plus a VIN.
- **PID manager**: 26 definitions, live values per row, search, filter,
  per-PID dashboard toggles.
- **PID editor, end to end**: name/unit/formula/range/priority, a live preview
  computing `A = 0x7B (123)` from typed test bytes, save, and the new
  definition then polling and reading on the dashboard.
- **Validation, on the device**: `NaN` typed into the range bound left the
  save button disabled. That is round 7's F-5 — the bound that pins a needle
  at full scale and then wedges `jsonEncode` — refused through the real UI.
  A missing name produced 「請輸入名稱。」 rather than a generic refusal.
- **Input normalisation**: the mode+PID field strips spaces as they are typed,
  so `01 0C` becomes `010C` at the widget. The normaliser added in round 8 is
  the backstop for the paths that bypass the widget — CSV import and paste.
- **Performance**: speed gauge live, target selector, and the timer refusing to
  arm while moving — 「請先完全停車 — 目前 84 km/h」, which names the current
  speed rather than just refusing.
- **Settings**: vehicle profile (displacement, mass, VE, Cd, frontal area,
  Crr), fuel type and drivetrain, theme.
- **Light theme**: switched from inside the app and checked on a *live* link.
  The gauges render the light palette — pastel through to saturated mid-tones
  — rather than the dark palette lightened, which is the failure the two
  separate palettes exist to avoid.
- **Text at 1.6×**: reflows, no clipping, no overflow.
- **Release build**: a signed release APK with R8 shrinking, built against the
  current fork pin, installed and run to a live session. Debug keeps
  everything the shrinker might remove, so this is where a missing keep rule
  or a stripped native symbol would show.

## What that pre-adapter round did not establish

- **Any real adapter.** At that point every clone behaviour modelled in this
  project was one someone described. The emulator is 11-bit CAN only, offers no functional
  addressing, and answers `ATSP3` with `OK` while still reporting `A6` — it
  does not refuse, it quietly misleads.
- **Any legacy bus.** J1850, ISO 9141-2 and ISO 14230-4 exist here only as
  fixtures written from the datasheet by the same person who wrote the code
  they test.
- **A completed Bluetooth session of either kind.** Enumeration, scanning and
  the failure cascade were covered; the handshake over RFCOMM or GATT was not.
- **The permission matrix on API 29/30/31+**, which needs those OS versions
  and not this one.
- **The fork's remaining native races** — cancel before the socket is
  registered, a blocked `OutputStream.write`, executor shutdown draining
  queued writes. The cascade timing above covers one of them and not these.
- **A moving vehicle.** The performance timer was armed and correctly refused;
  it has never completed a run against real road speed.

## Round 10 — the BLE package swap, 2026-08-18

`flutter_blue_plus` was replaced with `universal_ble`. That rewrites the layer
between the app and the OS radio, and the unit tests for it run against a fake
platform — so the one thing they cannot establish is that the real platform
channel works. This is what was checked on the device.

**The first attempt was worthless and is recorded because of it.**
`adb install -r -g app-debug.apk` printed
`Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE …]` and **exited 0**. The exit code
was believed, the app was launched, and the logcat collected showed
`flutter_blue_plus_version=2.3.12` — because the running app was still the
previous build. A verification that would have signed off a dependency
migration was, in fact, a test of yesterday's binary. The device held a
Play-signed build; rebuilding `--release` with the same key installed over it
cleanly, with no uninstall and no data loss, and exercised the shipping path
rather than the debug one.

What the corrected run establishes:

- Zero `[FBP-Android]` lines in logcat — the old package is genuinely gone from
  the running binary, rather than merely absent from the source tree.
- `BLE_GAP : SCAN_START :: appName: com.cbstudio.telltale` in the system log —
  the new package really opened the radio through the platform channel.
- A named peripheral (`WIN_DESKTOP`) rendered with its name; unnamed
  peripherals rendered as `未命名裝置 (<address>)` rather than being dropped.
  This is the fallback the fake platform also covers, confirmed against real
  advertisements.
- Signal bars varied across entries, so RSSI is arriving and not defaulting.
- No duplicated rows, despite the new package emitting one event per
  advertisement rather than an accumulated list.
- No Flutter exception in logcat during scan.

What that 2026-08-18 run did not establish: **nothing was connected to.**
Scanning exercises discovery, permissions and the radio; `connect()`, service
discovery, the notify/indicate branch and the MTU request were exercised only
against the fake platform. At round 10, the first real ELM327 BLE adapter
remained the test that mattered.

Also compiled on the two platforms that have no device coverage at all, purely
to establish that the new dependency builds there: `flutter build macos --debug`
→ `Telltale.app`, `flutter build ios --no-codesign --debug` → `Runner.app`.
Compilation is not verification, and neither has ever been run.

## Round 11 — the internal-test build on the device, 2026-08-20

`1.0.1+2` went to the Play internal testing track. This round is about getting
that same code onto the phone, and it turned up a fact about signing that has
nothing to do with the code and blocks the obvious way of doing it.

**Play App Signing means the store's build and a local build are different
applications to Android.** The upload key
(`CN=Torque OBD2`, SHA-256 `36:21:33:C0:04:BE:E5:E4:F4:58:F7:7D:4A:5D:19:99:48:A3:C5:CD:B9:F0:86:8B:E2:7D:6F:5D:91:09:A5:79`)
signs what is *uploaded*; Google re-signs with a separate app signing key before
delivery. The device holds a sideloaded build — `installerPackageName=null`,
signed with the upload key — so a build fetched from the internal-test track
cannot install over it. Android rejects it as a signature mismatch, and the only
way through is an uninstall, which takes the app's data with it: saved PID
definitions, dashboard layout, vehicle profile. **That cost is the user's to
accept, not the build's to impose**, so this round took the other route.

Rebuilt `--release` locally (same source, same `1.0.1+2`, signed with the upload
key) and installed over the existing build:

- `apksigner verify --print-certs` on the fresh APK → `CN=Torque OBD2`, digest
  `362133c0…9109a579`, byte-identical to the upload key Play holds. Checked
  **before** installing: the previous `app-release.apk` on disk was left
  community-signed by the release-workflow test, and installing that would have
  failed for a reason that looks exactly like this round's real one.
- `adb install -r -g` → `Success`, **and then** `dumpsys package` →
  `versionCode=2 versionName=1.0.1`, `lastUpdateTime` six seconds old. The exit
  code was not the evidence; round 10 is the reason why.
- `dataDir` unchanged and no uninstall — app data survived the update.
- Launched: `ResumedActivity: …com.cbstudio.telltale/.MainActivity`. Logcat over
  the launch: zero `flutter_blue_plus` lines, zero `FATAL`, zero `E/flutter`.

**No UI walkthrough this round.** The phone is locked with a secure lockscreen
and unlocking it is not something an agent should do; the app was launched
through `am start` and reached its resumed state behind the lock, which
establishes that it starts, not that any screen renders correctly. Round 10's
screen-by-screen evidence is the most recent of that kind, and it was taken on
`1.0.0+1` — the two builds differ only by the version bump and the release
metadata, but that is an argument, not an observation.

## Round 12 — the walkthrough the locked phone could not give, 2026-08-20

Round 11 got `1.0.1+2` onto the phone and no further: the device is locked with
a secure lockscreen. So the screen-by-screen pass ran on an emulator instead —
a Pixel 9 system image, API 36, the same release APK, the built-in Demo
transport. Every screen below was reached by tapping, and every claim is from a
screenshot.

- **Connect** — four transports listed, Demo expands to its description and
  `啟動模擬器`, connects.
- **Dashboard** — six gauges live, `77 PIDs/s`, `fastMode`, `14.0 V`, and the
  derived row (MAF air flow, fuel consumption, horsepower) updating with them.
- **PID manager** — 6 of 25 enabled, each row showing its mode/PID and formula
  next to a live value; disabled rows greyed with the toggle off.
- **DTC** — a full scan: VIN `1D4GP00R55B123456` over multiple frames, the
  freeze frame headed by its cause code `P0301` with twelve named values and an
  explicit note that two further entries had no conversion formula and were
  therefore **not** shown, readiness monitors in three states, and Mode 03's
  three codes (`P0301`, `P0420`, `U0123`) with descriptions and controller ids.
- **Performance** — armed at a 100 km/h target and then refused to run,
  reporting `請先完全停車 — 目前 60 km/h` and offering only a reset, which is
  the behaviour the demo's moving vehicle should produce.
- **Settings** — adapter self-report panel (`ELM327 v2.1` / `Torque Demo ECU`,
  with the warning that a consistent self-report is not proof of authenticity),
  vehicle profile sliders, manual command entry, theme, gauge skins.
- **Both themes** — light is the pastel-to-saturated palette rather than a
  dimmed copy of dark; text and gauge faces stayed legible on both.
- **Skins** — switching from `儀表艙` to `極簡` changed the geometry (ticks and
  needle gone, arc thickened), not just the colours.
- **Transcript export** — `匯出紀錄` produced
  `torque-obd-20260820-111759.txt` and handed it to the system share sheet as a
  file. This is the mechanism the whole "bring the recording back" workflow
  depends on, and it had never been exercised through the UI on a device.

**A blank screenshot from this emulator means the capture failed, not the app.**
On the first boot (hardware GPU) `screencap` returned a frame that was uniformly
`(0,0,0)` with zero alpha, while logcat showed `Using the Impeller rendering
backend (OpenGLES)` and `ActivityTaskManager: Fully drawn … +1s112ms` — the app
had drawn. Rebooting with `-gpu swiftshader_indirect` produced the screenshots
above from the same APK. Recorded because the next reader who sees a white
rectangle will otherwise start debugging the app.

What this does not establish: it is an emulator. Font rendering, display cutout
handling, real GPU behaviour and the Samsung skin are all untested by it, and
the transport was Demo — no socket, no protocol negotiation, no adapter. It
closes the "does 1.0.1+2 render and navigate" question and nothing beyond it.

## Round 13 — the recording did not survive a crash, 2026-08-20

The transcript export was walked in round 12 and worked. This round asked the
question that one does not: **what happens when the app dies without being
asked to?** — which is the situation the whole snapshot mechanism exists for,
and which had never been triggered on any device.

Two deaths, on the emulator, `1.0.1+2`, Demo transport, snapshot cleared first
so nothing could be mistaken for a leftover:

| how it died | before this round |
|---|---|
| home, then `am force-stop` | **recording intact.** Offered on the next launch, 138 KB, top of the connect screen, exports as `torque-obd-…-recovered.txt` |
| `am crash` from the foreground | **nothing.** `FATAL EXCEPTION`, `has died: fg TOP`, and the next launch offered no recording at all |

The second is the app crashing in a car. It is the session most worth sending
back, and it was the only one with no record — because the snapshot was written
by the pause and teardown handlers, and a foreground crash runs neither.

Fixed: a live session now writes every 30 seconds, and only when the transcript
has grown since the last write. `ObdTranscript.recorded` counts entries ever
recorded including the ones the ring buffer dropped, so a long session does not
stop saving at the point it has the most to say. Three tests, one of them
mutation-checked — removing the single line that starts the timer turns the
first one red.

Re-run on the device after the fix, same `am crash` from the foreground: the
next launch offered **142 KB, stamped 14:13**, the minute of the crash. The
most a crash can now cost is one interval.

What this does not establish: the emulator's `am crash` raises an exception on
the main thread. A native crash, an OOM kill, or a battery reaching zero are
different deaths, and only the last of those is likely in a car. All three are
covered by the same mechanism — the file is already on disk before they happen
— but none of them has been triggered here.

## Round 14 — a real GATT peripheral, built rather than bought, 2026-08-20

Round 10 verified BLE as far as scanning: the radio really opened, real
advertisements really arrived. Everything after that — connect, service
discovery, the CCCD subscribe, notifications — had only ever run against a
scripted fake platform, and it is exactly the region that changed when the BLE
package was replaced. I had written that closing it needed hardware I do not
have. That was a conclusion, not a measurement, and it was wrong.

A Mac has a radio. `tool/ble_test_rig/` now advertises Nordic UART from it and
forwards every write to Ircama's ELM327-emulator over TCP, returning each reply
as notifications — so both ends of the conversation are code this project did
not write. Verified from a clean machine state (venv and bundle deleted first,
because a rig that only works where it was built is not a rig): the emulator
listens, the peripheral advertises.

Two macOS behaviours had to be found the hard way, and both are recorded in the
rig's README because each one looks like a different bug than it is:

- **CoreBluetooth aborts instead of failing.** Any process without
  `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` in an `Info.plist` dies with `SIGABRT`,
  no traceback, nothing on stderr. The reason exists only in
  `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/*.ips` under `"namespace":"TCC"`. A bare
  `python3` has no `Info.plist`, so every attempt died silently.
- **A bundle alone does not help.** TCC attributes the request to the
  *responsible* process — the terminal, for anything run from a shell. Launching
  the same interpreter through LaunchServices (`open -n -a`) makes the bundle
  responsible for itself, and the identical script then works. Proof it is the
  mechanism and not luck: the first successful run scanned 27 real peripherals.

**What still blocks the end-to-end run: a Mac's central cannot see its own
peripheral.** CoreBluetooth does not loop back — an independent `bleak` client
on the same machine reported `NOT FOUND` against a peripheral that was
demonstrably advertising. A second device has to be the central, and the
obvious one is the phone, which is locked with a secure lockscreen. So the rig
is built, verified as far as this machine can verify it, and one unlocked phone
away from closing the last gap in the BLE path.

## Round 15 — what the emulator's radio actually is, 2026-08-20

Round 14 left the rig advertising and the question open: can the Android
emulator's Bluetooth reach the host's radio? I had asserted it could not,
without testing it. Tested now, with `-feature Bluetooth` and the rig
advertising `TelltaleELM` from the Mac:

- The emulator has a real adapter — `state: ON`, its own MAC.
- Tapping 搜尋 BLE 裝置 ran a **real scan**: Android's own stack logged
  `le_scanning_manager` starting and stopping, `le_address_manager` registering
  a client, `BluetoothAdapter: isLeEnabled(): ON`.
- It found nothing. The emulator's Bluetooth is a closed virtual stack; it does
  not see the host's radio. So the assertion was right and the reasoning was
  not, and this is now a measurement.

**The trip found a real defect anyway, which is the argument for taking it.**
A BLE scan that finishes with no results rendered *nothing*: the panel returned
to exactly its pre-tap state. `_BleBody` only ever built a list when
`_found.isNotEmpty`, with no else branch, while the Classic branch has carried
an `emptyHint` since it was written. Somebody standing at a car reads that
silence as a broken app, and cannot see any of the three things that actually
cause it.

Fixed with `bleEmptyScanGuidance`, gated on a scan having finished — greeting
somebody with an explanation of a failure that has not happened would be its
own defect. Both exits set the flag, including the one that throws, or an error
message would still sit above a silent empty list. Verified by rebuilding,
reinstalling, and walking it: before the scan, nothing; after it, the guidance.

Also confirmed in passing: with the rig's ELM327 emulator running, the suite
reports **7 skipped rather than 12** — the five Ircama oracle tests ran and
passed against a simulator this project did not write. The number is the
evidence that they ran.

## Round 16 — the last mile, reduced to one action, 2026-08-20

The BLE gap has a fixed shape: the rig advertises a real peripheral, and the
app has to be driven on a device that can see it. Every attempt to close it by
hand ran into the same wall — `adb shell input` goes to the lockscreen, not to
the app behind it, and every phone worth testing on has a secure lockscreen.

`integration_test/ble_rig_test.dart` removes that wall. It injects widget
events directly, so it does not care whether anyone is looking at the screen:
it opens the Bluetooth LE section, scans, taps `TelltaleELM`, and waits for the
handshake to reach the dashboard.

**It fails rather than skips when no peripheral is found.** The oracles in this
repository skip when their simulator is absent, and CI has a guard that fails
the job if they did — because a green that cannot distinguish "checked" from
"never ran" is not green. Here the same reasoning points the other way: this
test exists only to prove a real connection happened, so having nothing to
connect to is a failure of the run, and the message says what to start and
where.

Verified on an emulator: the test drove the app through the scan and stopped at
its own `fail`, with the message it was written to produce. That is the correct
outcome where the radio is virtual — and it establishes the half that does not
need hardware, that the driver reaches the right controls in the right order
and can tell a connection from an absence.

Two obstacles worth recording, because both look like the test being broken:
`flutter test` reported `No tests ran — Error waiting for a debug connection`
with two devices attached, fixed by setting `ANDROID_SERIAL` alongside `-d`;
and a debug build cannot install over a release-signed one.

What remains is one device that can see the peripheral. On a phone that means
an unlock and an uninstall — the uninstall takes saved PIDs, dashboard layout
and vehicle profile with it, which is why it has not been done unasked.

## Round 17 — the real GATT path, on a phone, 2026-08-20

The phone was unlocked, so the region rounds 10 and 14 could not reach finally
ran on real hardware: `1.0.2+3`, installed over the previous build with the
upload key so no data was lost, and verified as versionCode 3 by `dumpsys`
rather than by `adb install` saying `Success` — which it also said, five
minutes earlier, while installing 1.0.1+2 from a stale build.

**The rig was not what closed it.** The Mac advertised — `isAdvertising: True`,
asked of CoreBluetooth rather than inferred from `start()` returning `None`,
which is not a signal at all — and the phone scanned 30+ real peripherals
including a Windows desktop, an Android tablet and a smart door lock. It never
saw `TelltaleELM`. An Apple peripheral advertised from a UI-less process is not
reliably visible to a non-Apple central, and nothing here disproved that.

**What closed it was one of the peripherals already on screen.** Every device in
that scan is a real GATT server. Tapping `WIN_DESKTOP` — plainly not an ELM327
— exercised the whole untested region against real hardware:

- **connect** succeeded,
- **service discovery** succeeded and found a writable/notifiable pair, because
  the app moved on to the handshake rather than reporting no UART service,
- **the subscribe** succeeded and `ATZ` went out over a real characteristic,
- `ATZ` timed out (a desktop does not answer AT commands), `ATE0` was reported
  `已中止`, and the screen showed `ELM327 初始化（上次嘗試）2 / 14` with the
  failing step named.

The wording held up where it matters: **初始化未通過，轉接器可能不相容** — a
claim about the adapter, hedged, with no assertion about any vehicle. Beneath it
the export was offered with 「這次嘗試的完整往返紀錄留著了。帶回來比一句訊息有用。」
No crash, no Flutter exception, no frozen UI, and the adapter was remembered with
直接連線 / 忘記 offered on return.

What this does not establish: no ELM327 answered. Clone timing, `SEARCHING...`
on a physical bus, a link dropping when the engine cranks, and every PID formula
against a real ECU remain untested. But "connect, discover and subscribe have
never run outside a fake platform" — true since the package swap — is no longer
true.

## Round 18 — the phone, with everything that does not need an adapter, 2026-08-20

Same session, same unlocked phone, `1.0.2+3`. Round 12's screen-by-screen pass
was on an emulator; this is the Samsung, at its own resolution, under One UI.

**A defect, found the moment the screen was read rather than assumed.** The
connect screen offered the recording from the failed BLE attempt as **0 KB**.
`(bytes / 1024).toStringAsFixed(0)` renders anything under 512 bytes as zero,
and a failed handshake is a few hundred bytes — so the recording with the most
diagnostic value in it was the one displayed as nothing, directly under a
sentence promising it had been kept. Nobody exports a file the app has just
called empty. Fixed, and verified against the *same stored recording*, which
now reads `178 位元組`.

What else ran, all against the Demo transport:

- Dashboard live at **81 PIDs/s** — higher than the emulator's 77, which is
  what real silicon should look like.
- A full fault-code scan: VIN over multiple frames, the freeze frame gated on
  `P0301` with twelve named values and the explicit note that two more had no
  conversion formula, the MIL state, readiness monitors.

**The crash-recovery rule and the simulator-precedence rule, both on hardware,
in one sequence.** `am crash` from the foreground — `FATAL EXCEPTION`,
`has died: fg TOP` — and the next launch still offered the recording. And it
offered the *right* one: the Demo session had been running for over forty
seconds, well past a snapshot interval, but the timestamp stayed at 16:10, the
BLE attempt. A simulator session did not overwrite a recording made from real
hardware.

That is exactly the scenario `docs/field-guide.zh-TW.md` describes — something goes wrong
at the car, you get home, you tap Demo to check whether the app itself is
broken — and it had never been run. Now it has, in that order, on the phone.

**The share sheet, on One UI.** `torque-obd-…-recovered.txt`, one item, with a
TXT icon — the `text/plain` MIME type is being declared rather than inferred,
which is the thing `transcript_export.dart` says it fixed. The Quick Share
「儲存」 button the field guide warns about sits second in the row, exactly
where the guide says it will be.

Still not established, and now the only thing left: no ELM327 has answered.

## Round 19 — a Dart exception, on screen, in a car park, 2026-08-20

Still hunting the rig on the phone: connect to each unnamed peripheral and
watch `/tmp/ble_bridge.log` for a GATT write. One of them accepted the
connection and then answered nothing — and the screen said:

    TimeoutException after 0:00:10.000000: Future not completed

That is `'$e'` from `obd_session.dart`, reaching a person. One branch away, a
failed handshake says 轉接器可能不相容, which somebody can act on; the connect
path had no equivalent, so anything that was not a `TransportException` arrived
verbatim.

It needed exactly this to find: a peripheral that accepts a GATT link and stays
silent. The demo transport connects instantly, the fake platform in the unit
tests throws typed errors, and a real ELM327 answers. Nothing in the suite
produces a bare `TimeoutException` at connect.

Fixed as two audiences rather than by deleting anything:

| reader | gets |
|---|---|
| the driver | 轉接器接受了連線，但在時限內沒有回應… plus the two causes worth checking |
| whoever reads the transcript later | `TimeoutException after 0:00:10.000000: Future not completed`, verbatim |

`_failAttempt` takes a `detail`, and the transcript records that instead of the
sentence. Both halves are tested: the screen text must not contain the class
name or the message, and the transcript must.

Verified on the phone by reconnecting to the same peripheral through 直接連線 —
which also exercised the remembered-adapter path, connecting without a scan.

**Three defects in one sitting, all the same shape.** `0 KB` for a 178-byte
recording, a blank panel after an empty scan, and a raw exception on screen:
each was true, and none of them was an answer. The app was telling somebody
standing at a car something technically correct that they could do nothing
with — which is the failure this whole repository is organised against, arriving
by a door nobody had checked because reaching it needs real hardware behaving
badly.

## Round 20 — an ELM327 answered, 2026-08-20

Every round since the package swap has ended on the same sentence: no ELM327
has ever replied to this app. That was true, and it was also a failure of
imagination — the rig had been aimed at BLE because BLE was the untested
transport, and the app has a Wi-Fi transport that speaks TCP to any host on the
network. Ircama's ELM327-emulator listens on 35000. The phone and this Mac are
on the same subnet.

Phone `192.168.1.139` → `192.168.1.135:35000`, on the real network, against an
ELM327 implementation this project did not write:

- **The handshake completed.** `AUTO, ISO 15765-4 (CAN 11/500)` — the protocol
  was detected, not assumed.
- **8 PIDs/s**, against the demo's 81. Real latency, over real Wi-Fi.
- **`單筆模式`, not fastMode.** The app tried a batched request and fell back.
  The emulator's own log shows what it saw:
  `Unknown request: '0104110B10050F', header=7E0` — the batch, unrecognised.
  The fallback is not a guess about this emulator; it is the app reacting to
  being refused.
- **13.3 V** from `ATRV`, and six live gauges with derived figures behind them.
- **VIN `WP0ZZZ99ZTS390000`** over Mode 09, reassembled from multiple frames.

**And the fault-code screen refused to lie.** This emulator does not model
functional addressing, so the app's correct request — `ATSH 7DF` then `03` —
gets nothing. Its log confirms the app addressed it properly:
`Unknown request: '0101', header=7DF`. The screen said:

> **無法確認** — 車輛沒有回應 Mode 03 查詢，因此無法確認是否有已儲存的故障碼。
> 這與「沒有故障碼」不是同一件事。

…and the same for Modes 07 and 0A, each naming why it could not tell "the
vehicle does not support this" from "this connection did not read it". The
heading read 無法確認 rather than 共 0 筆.

`docs/verification/review-log.md` lists "DTC 讀取失敗顯示無故障碼" as a HIGH defect and calls it
a false all-clear on a diagnostic screen. This is that fix, on a phone, against
a third-party implementation, refusing to give the answer that would have been
comfortable.

At the end of round 20, what was still untested was a short list: a real
ELM327's timing, a clone's quirks, `SEARCHING...` on a physical bus, a link that
drops when the engine cranks, and every PID formula against an ECU rather than
a simulator's canned values.

## 2026-08-24 — the Wi-Fi route lease, from red tests to the release build on the phone

The previous session left five tests for a `WifiRouteBinder` and no
implementation — the deferred fix named in `wifi_transport.dart`'s own comment:
bind the socket to the Wi-Fi network for exactly the moment it is created, so
an adapter hotspot Android refuses to trust cannot silently send the connect
out over cellular. This session took the fix: a bind → connect →
release-immediately lease in the transport, an Android platform-channel binder
over `ConnectivityManager` (TRANSPORT_WIFI, validated or not — the hotspot
never validates), a loopback bypass in the binder so every `adb reverse` rig
stays out of the gamble, and the bind's cost deducted from the one connect
budget.

One of the five tests could never have passed as written: it awaited
`peer.done` on the server side, and `Socket.done` is `IOSink.done` — it
completes on a *local* close and never observes the remote end dying (measured:
both `destroy()` and `close()` left it hanging). The assertion now listens to
the peer's stream, which an implementation that leaks the socket still fails.

**Host evidence.** `flutter analyze` clean; the full suite green with exactly
13 skipped, twice — before and after the final edits. Then all 13 were made to
actually run: Ircama's five against a live emulator, the freeze-frame oracle's
seven against the project-owned hash-pinned research server, and the chaos
oracle through the TCP fault proxy three times — close, no_prompt, corrupt —
each failing closed at the intended initialization command.

**Emulator.** `demo_rig_test` and `classic_rig_test` passed; classic also
produced one genuine-looking failure on its first run and the integration
driver twice hung after `Installing … 8.1s` with the test never starting,
killed after 30 minutes each. Recorded as an emulator-driver environment
problem: the same tests pass on the phone in seconds.

**Phone (SM-S9280), the part that matters.** Four rig tests, four passes, each
in 2–6 seconds: Demo, Classic through the mocked plugin boundary, Wi-Fi over
`adb reverse` loopback, and Wi-Fi against `192.168.1.135` — the first
execution of the real `bindProcessToNetwork` path on real hardware: One UI
found its Wi-Fi network, bound, connected across the air to an ELM327
implementation nobody here wrote, released, and the session reached live
polling and persisted its clearly-simulated evidence.

**BLE rig, honestly.** Two fresh advertising windows, and the phone never saw
`TelltaleELM`, while the bridge logged `is_advertising: true` once per second
throughout. That is round 17's Apple-peripheral visibility problem resurfaced,
not a regression — nothing in this session touched BLE code — and the
2026-08-23 GATT run remains the standing hardware evidence. Stopped after two
attempts rather than retried into significance.

**The release build, driven live.** `--release --flavor field`, signed with
the upload key (digest checked byte-identical before installing), installed
over 1.0.4+5 with no uninstall — `dataDir` unchanged, and the connect screen
proved it by offering the remembered adapter from a previous round. Wi-Fi to
Ircama at `192.168.1.135:35000` on the phone's real radio through the R8-shrunk
binder path: `AUTO, ISO 15765-4 (CAN 11/500)`, six gauges at 8 PIDs/s,
單筆模式 correctly on, `13.3 V` from a real `ATRV`. The new connect-screen
wording about the route binding renders. Disconnected through 設定, back to a
clean connect screen. `logcat`: zero `E/flutter`, zero `FATAL EXCEPTION`, zero
`ClassNotFoundException` / `NoSuchMethodError` / `MissingPluginException`.

**A field defect the suite was already testing for, and blessing.** Driving
the release build through the remembered-adapter shortcut — 直接連線, which no
successful Wi-Fi session had ever used before — connected, completed the
handshake 14/14, started polling (the emulator's log shows the poll traffic),
and **stayed on the connection screen**. A live session, gauges turning
nowhere, under a screen that looks like nothing happened. The mechanism: the
wizard hides the shortcut card for the whole busy phase, which unmounts the
widget whose context initiated the connect; when the await resolved, the
`context.mounted` check quietly dropped the navigation. All three transports'
shortcuts shared the path.

The instructive part is that `remembered_adapter_navigation_test.dart` already
existed, asserted exactly "success opens the dashboard", and passed — its mock
resolved within a microtask, before the next frame could rebuild the tree, so
the card never unmounted and the dead-context path never ran. The fix to the
*test* is a gate the test holds open across one pumped frame, which turned all
three success cases red against the shipped code; the fix to the *code* is
taking the app-scoped router before the first await. Re-walked on the phone:
直接連線 now lands on a live dashboard.

**The adapter dying mid-session, twice, honestly reported.** The Ircama
instance wedged during one walk (its single-client socket was still held by
the rig test's never-closed session), and a second wedge was staged
deliberately with `SIGSTOP`. Both times the app reported
轉接器停止回應，連線已中斷 with the completed init panel above it — and the
staged one proved the teardown closes the TCP socket (the Mac-side connection
cleared within the watchdog window), as does the UI's 中斷連線. A wedged
adapter cannot strand a half-open socket that would hold a real single-client
ELM327's port hostage on reconnect.

**Three review rounds, and what each changed.** A dual review (Codex GPT-5.6
max + Fable 5 xhigh) ran before anything was called done. Round 1 produced the
compensating release for an abandoned bind (channel FIFO guarantees it lands
after a late native bind), a catch-all lease release so an injectable
connector cannot leak the process binding through a novel exception shape,
and the budget/ordering tests. Round 2 confirmed those and left one open item
— bind succeeding proves nothing about the destination — which round 3's
shape closed: the host crosses the channel (numeric literals only, checked on
both sides so the synchronous handler can never be handed a DNS lookup), the
Wi-Fi whose link subnet contains the adapter is preferred, the never-validated
one next, and a genuine tie at the top **refuses** with
`ambiguous_wifi_network` rather than deterministically binding a coin flip
that would time out identically on every retry with the adapter taking the
blame. Known native refusals now reach the screen as actionable 繁體中文
rather than transcript English. Each round's fixes were re-run on the phone;
the final binary's walk is the one above. Remaining known gap from review: the
Kotlin selection logic has compile-and-review coverage only — this project has
no native test harness, and `sameSubnet` was instead checked by a reviewer's
independent 913,825-case reference model.

**What this does not establish.** The adversarial network condition the binder
exists for — an internet-less hotspot the phone has never accepted, with
cellular live and Samsung's hand-off armed — was not staged today; the home
Wi-Fi validates, so the bind executed but was not what saved the connection.
Dual-STA ambiguity handling likewise refused or resolved only on paper and in
Dart-side tests. At the end of this 2026-08-24 round, the standing gaps were no
purchased adapter, no vehicle, and no completed Bluetooth session against a
real ELM327. The 2026-08-27 observation at the top of this file later closed
that blanket gap for one purchased BLE adapter and one GT86 connection only;
it did not add the missing protocol-level transcript review.

## What would move this forward, in order of value

1. Privately review the retained 2026-08-27 transcript, then publish only a
   redacted protocol summary that cannot expose VIN or device identifiers.
2. Repeat a documented stationary ignition-on and engine-on sequence with the
   same adapter, recording identity replies, protocol, polling, and failures.
3. Test a second adapter and a legacy vehicle; one GT86 connection cannot
   establish clone-to-clone or vehicle-generation compatibility.
