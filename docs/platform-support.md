# Platform support

Telltale is a Flutter app. The Dart package name stays `torque_obd`; the product
identity users see is **Telltale** / `com.cbstudio.telltale`.

## Verification backbone

Private `ImL1s/torque` Actions may be unavailable (billing). **Public
`ImL1s/telltale` CI is the authoritative remote matrix** for multiplatform
enablement. Compile gates are necessary but **not sufficient**: functional
smoke (Demo journey, Wi‑Fi TCP unit path, export, host gates) must also pass
on free runners. Product code still originates in private `app/` and is
archive-synced; telltale `.github/` is publish-only. The harness map is
[`docs/verification/harness-catalog.json`](verification/harness-catalog.json),
checked by `test/harness_catalog_test.dart`.

## Functional matrix (honest)

Legend: **pass** = exercised by automated test and/or local run evidence on
this branch · **wired** = code path present, field/device evidence still thin ·
**OS-blocked** = host cannot provide the capability · **deferred** = not yet
proven to the full smoothness bar.

## Bluetooth Classic (SPP)

UI predicate: `classicTransportAvailable` → **Android, macOS, Windows, or
Linux**. Guidance, transport cards, and remembered-adapter reconnect all fail
closed together. Automated coverage: `which_transport_test`,
`remembered_adapter_navigation_test`, `serial_transport_test`,
`macos_classic_iobluetooth_contract_test`, and reconnect host-gate tests.
**Classic-on-iOS is not a bug** — the card stays grey with an explicit OS
reason. **Classic-on-macOS is wired** through IOBluetooth RFCOMM (not a POSIX
TTY). BLE empty-scan / “which transport” copy never points at Classic when the
host gate is closed.

| Host | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Android | Supported | Verified ELM327 RFCOMM/SPP (three-tier cascade incl. `connect(channel:)`) |
| iOS | **Permanent OS/API host gate** | No generic third-party SPP |
| Windows | **Wired — Bluetooth SPP COM** | Pairing creates `Standard Serial over Bluetooth link (COMx)`. App enumerates Bluetooth-associated COM ports via SetupAPI (`BTHENUM` / friendly “Bluetooth”) and opens them at 38400 8N1 through `SerialTransport` + `com.cbstudio.telltale/spp_serial`. Partial `WriteFile` loops until every byte is accepted. Winsock `AF_BTH` with `port=0` still needs SDP and does **not** replace `connect(channel:)`. Field connect→PID still needs a powered adapter on a Windows box |
| Linux | **Wired — RFCOMM TTY** | Same Dart channel + `SerialTransport` as Windows. Native runner enumerates `/dev/rfcomm*` and Bluetooth-backed tty nodes (sysfs path contains `bluetooth`/`rfcomm`/`hci`), opens at 38400 8N1 (`termios`), and streams inbound bytes on the EventChannel. Empty enumeration is honest — the Classic card is available but the wizard reports no ports until BlueZ has bound an RFCOMM node. With `VMIN=0`/`VTIME=2`, a zero-length `read()` is an idle timeout, not hangup. Field connect→PID still needs a powered adapter + bound TTY on a Linux box |
| macOS | **Wired — IOBluetooth RFCOMM** | Product path is `ClassicTransport` → `flutter_classic_bluetooth` → `IOBluetoothDevice.openRFCOMMChannelAsync` (SDP UUID → channel, else channel 1). Entitlement `com.apple.security.device.bluetooth` is present. macOS does **not** create per-paired-SPP POSIX TTYs comparable to Windows COM / Linux rfcomm — `/dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port` is the host **incoming** serial profile, and incidental `cu.<device>` nodes (earbuds etc.) are not a general SPP enumeration surface — so `SerialTransport` / `spp_serial` stays Windows/Linux-only. Empty bonded list / radio-off fails closed in the wizard. Field connect→PID still needs a powered ELM327 paired on this Mac |

Linux CI still needs `libbluetooth-dev` because `flutter_classic_bluetooth`'s
Linux CMake requires BlueZ headers at configure time (plugin link), even though
the product Classic path on Linux is the RFCOMM serial channel above.

## Bluetooth LE

`bleTransportAvailable` → **true** on every shipping host.

- Android / iOS / macOS / Windows: `universal_ble` native plugins.
- Linux: Dart BlueZ backend (`package:bluez` over D-Bus). **No** Flutter
  plugin registrant is expected. Runtime needs BlueZ; compile CI does not need
  an adapter. Field evidence with a real ELM327 BLE dongle on Linux is still
  required before calling Linux BLE “mature”.

Scan preflight checks `getBluetoothAvailabilityState()` and maps powered-off /
unauthorized / BlueZ-D-Bus failures to actionable Chinese copy
(`BleRadioUnavailableException` / `BleTransport.userFacingScanFailure`).
Automated coverage: `test/ble_transport_test.dart` (poweredOff, unauthorized,
BlueZ string mapping) plus empty-scan guidance tests. Do not treat green CI as
a field BLE pass.

### When an adapter arrives (field verify)

Power the dongle (ignition ON), then from the Flutter app root:

```bash
# One command: ACL preflight → field debug install → BLE/Classic journey
tool/field_bt_verify/run.sh
# ACL / bonded inventory only:
tool/field_bt_verify/run.sh --probe-only
```

Manual inventory still useful:

```bash
# macOS inventory
system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | rg -i 'OBD|ELM|V-?LINK|Vgate'

# Android bonded + ACL flags
ADB=~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb
$ADB -s R5CX10VFFBA shell dumpsys bluetooth_manager | strings | rg -i 'OBD|ELM|ACL BR/EDR'
```

The harness writes observation vs qualification under
`docs/verification/field-bt-probe-*.txt`. ACL-down is **disconnected**, not a
field PASS and not “unpowered / out of range”. A field PASS still requires a
fresh connect → PID → record in that run; `--probe-only` never prints it.
Details: [`tool/field_bt_verify/README.md`](../tool/field_bt_verify/README.md).

Historical Android field transcript on this workstation (adapter presently
unpowered): `/sdcard/Download/torque-obd-20260827-133618-recovered.txt` —
`OBDBLE` over BLE (`FFF0`/`FFF1`), `ELM327 v1.5`, ISO 15765-4 CAN 11/500.

## Desktop / Apple runnable notes

- **macOS:** network client + Bluetooth entitlements; Demo smoke-launched
  locally as `Telltale.app`. SystemChrome orientation skipped on desktop.
  Share uses the native `com.cbstudio.telltale/app_share` channel after
  `app_storage_capacity`. Field debug share journey
  (`integration_test/macos_field_share_journey_test.dart`) proves capacity →
  Demo record → immutable staged CSV handoff; the OS picker itself is still a
  human step. Failed/unavailable handoffs return `shareHandoffFailed` with
  clear copy (file staged, sheet did not open) — never a silent success.
  Desktop Wi‑Fi functional evidence: `tool/desktop_wifi_oracle/run.sh` starts
  Ircama with `-d` (required on macOS background shells) and runs
  `emulator_integration_test.dart` (`ELM_ORACLE_REQUIRED`) proving handshake,
  VIN, live RPM/speed polling, record, and export over `WifiTransport`.
  Unsigned packaging: `tool/packaging/macos_dmg.sh` (notarization called out,
  not automated). `default-flavor: field` requires matching Xcode scheme +
  configs (`field.xcscheme`, `Debug-field`/`Release-field`/`Profile-field`);
  Android-only `rig` stays out of Apple schemes.
- **Windows / Linux:** runners now register
  `com.cbstudio.telltale/app_storage_capacity` (`GetDiskFreeSpaceExW` /
  `statvfs`) so share preflight is no longer a permanent `shareSpaceUnknown`
  dead-end. When the interactive sheet cannot open, UX reports staged-but-
  handoff-failed instead of pretending the picker confirmed. Packaging:
  `tool/packaging/windows_zip.sh` / `linux_tarball.sh` (MSIX / AppImage /
  Flatpak stubs documented beside them). Single-instance: Windows named mutex
  `Local\\com.cbstudio.telltale.single_instance`; Linux uses
  `G_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_FLAGS` (unique GTK application id) so a second
  process cannot corrupt live `.ndjson.part` / share leases via startup
  recovery.
- **Windows:** `Telltale` / `telltale.exe`; MSVC coroutine silence for
  `permission_handler_windows` (plural `_SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_COROUTINE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS`,
  matching MSVC STL1011’s own suppress token).
- **Linux:** wakelock no-op; Demo / Wi‑Fi / BLE (BlueZ) do not depend on it.
  Public telltale CI runs the Ircama Wi‑Fi oracle on Linux runners.
- **iOS:** Classic permanently unavailable; Demo / Wi‑Fi / BLE are the core
  path. Field Simulator evidence:
  `integration_test/ios_field_demo_journey_test.dart` (Demo → live PIDs →
  record → durable session file) and
  `tool/ios_wifi_oracle/run.sh` / `ios_field_wifi_oracle_test.dart` (Simulator
  → host LAN `en0` Ircama → handshake → live PIDs on `TransportKind.wifi`).
  The BLE entrypoint stays loopback-only by default; the iOS Wi‑Fi harness
  sets `ELM_BIND_INTERFACE=0.0.0.0` for that run only. Same `field` scheme
  requirement as macOS for `default-flavor`. All share entry points
  (telemetry, raw/recovered transcript, PID CSV) accept `sharePositionOrigin`
  for iPad popovers.

## Hardware inventory (this workstation, 2026-09-01)

- Android attached: `R5CX10VFFBA` (S24 Ultra), `RFCNC0WNT9H`, `emulator-5554`.
- S24 Ultra bonded list includes **`OBDBLE` / `OBDII` (SPP)** — dual-mode
  adapter historically proven over BLE on 2026-08-27 (see recovered transcript
  above). Re-check `field-bt-probe-20260831T235526Z` via
  `tool/field_bt_verify/run.sh --probe-only`: phone BT **ON**, ACL BR/EDR and
  LE both still **N** (`ConnectionState` disconnected). Treat as **observation:
  disconnected** — not unpowered, and not a field PASS. No fresh
  connect→PID→record that session. Prior
  same-day checks `20260831T232922Z` / `20260831T223755Z` /
  `20260831T222101Z` / `20260831T212448Z` reached the same verdict.
- macOS paired set is phones/keyboards/earbuds/gamepads only (no ELM327).
  Classic UI is enabled via IOBluetooth RFCOMM; field proof still needs a
  powered adapter paired to this Mac.
- iOS Simulator Demo + LAN Wi‑Fi oracle already evidenced on this branch
  (host `en0` = `192.168.1.135` at time of proof).

## Still deferred (does **not** meet the full functional bar alone)

- Store packaging (signed MSIX / Flathub Flatpak / notarized DMG) — unsigned
  zip/tarball/DMG recipes exist under `tool/packaging/` and CI uploads debug
  archives
- Windows / Linux / macOS Classic **field** proof (powered ELM327 → connect →
  PID → record → export on a real host). Software paths are wired; evidence is
  not.
- Linux / desktop BLE field verification against a **powered** adapter
- Human confirmation of every desktop share-sheet target (macOS staging +
  channel handoff is proven; picker selection is not automated)
- Keyboard/mouse shell density polish
- Notarized / store-signed packages (unsigned archives only)
