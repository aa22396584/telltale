/// deeper has already handed bytes to an OS buffer, a GATT queue or an RFCOMM
/// stream, and a failure there says nothing about whether the adapter saw
/// them.
///
/// The distinction is not academic. `PollingEngine.clearDtcs` decides from the
/// write audit whether repeating a global Mode 04 could reach a controller
/// that has already erased its memory. Without this type the audit had to
/// record the command *before* calling `write`, so a write rejected at the
/// guard was reported as "sent, do not retry" — locking the button on a clear
/// that had provably not happened, and stranding somebody who could safely
/// have tapped it again.

/// conservative direction: an unknown failure must read as possibly-sent. This

/// again — which is right for a link that dropped and wrong for a structural
/// condition. Retried silently, this one produces a gauge that is dark forever
/// with nothing on screen to say why, which is the failure it was raised to
/// prevent.
/// The operation's owner expired before its bytes went out.
///
/// A distinct type because it is not a failure of the link or the vehicle:
/// nothing was transmitted and nothing is wrong. Callers that would otherwise
/// mark a PID faulty or a scan broken should recognise it as "the app stopped
/// asking", which is what it is.
