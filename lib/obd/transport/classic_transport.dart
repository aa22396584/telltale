/// Bluetooth Classic RFCOMM / SPP transport (tier 1).
///
/// This is what the cheap ELM327 dongles use. Android in practice: iOS exposes
/// RFCOMM only to MFi-registered accessories, so the connection wizard hides
/// this option there rather than offering a link that cannot work.
///
/// ## The three-tier connection cascade
///
/// 1. **Secure, by UUID.** What a well-behaved adapter answers.
/// 2. **Insecure, by UUID.** Rescues devices whose SDP record is present but
///    which refuse an authenticated handshake — the most common clone failure.
/// 3. **Insecure, on RFCOMM channel 1.** Skips service discovery entirely.
///
/// The third tier exists because both UUID paths perform an SDP lookup and
/// fail outright when the device publishes no usable SPP record. Cheap ELM327
/// clones frequently listen on channel 1 and advertise nothing: they are
/// discoverable, they pair normally, and they cannot be connected to by UUID
/// at all.
///
/// Upstream `flutter_classic_bluetooth` 0.1.8 has no such path — it calls
/// `createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord` and its insecure twin and nothing else,
/// which was verified by reading its Android source. `connect(channel:)` was
/// added in a fork and the dependency is pinned to that commit; see
/// `pubspec.yaml`.
///
/// Each tier begins only after the previous one has genuinely *terminated*,
/// timeouts included. That is a property of the pinned fork rather than of
/// this file: `connect(timeout:)` calls `cancelConnect` before throwing, which
/// closes the socket and releases the native call blocked in
/// `BluetoothSocket.connect()`. Without that a timeout would leave a socket
/// racing the next tier for an adapter that accepts one link — which is why
/// this used to abort instead, at the cost of never reaching tier 3.
