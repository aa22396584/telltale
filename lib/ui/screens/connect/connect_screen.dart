/// - **Android:** RFCOMM three-tier cascade (`ClassicTransport`).
/// - **macOS:** IOBluetooth RFCOMM via `flutter_classic_bluetooth`
///   (`openRFCOMMChannelAsync`, SDP → channel else channel 1). macOS does
///   **not** expose paired SPP as a general POSIX TTY the way Windows COM /
///   Linux `/dev/rfcomm*` do (`/dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port` is the host
///   incoming serial profile, not remote-ELM327 enumeration), so the product
///   path is the plugin — not `SerialTransport`.
/// - **Windows / Linux:** Bluetooth SPP serial (38400 8N1) via
///   `SerialTransport` + `com.cbstudio.telltale/spp_serial`.
/// - **iOS:** permanent OS/API host limit — no generic third-party SPP.
