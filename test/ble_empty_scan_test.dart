/// Found on an emulator, 2026-08-20: tapping 搜尋 BLE 裝置 ran a real scan —
/// Android's stack logged `le_scanning_manager` start and stop — found nothing,
/// and the screen returned to exactly the state it was in before. No message,
/// no result, no next step. The Bluetooth Classic branch has had an
/// `emptyHint` for this since it was written; the BLE branch never got one.

/// This is the connect screen's worst moment to be silent. Somebody is
/// standing at a car with an adapter plugged in, and the three things that
/// actually cause it — the adapter has no power because the ignition is off,
/// they are out of range, or the adapter is a Classic one and this is the
/// wrong list — are all invisible from a blank panel. Silence reads as "the
/// app is broken", which is the one conclusion that helps nobody.
