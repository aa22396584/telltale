/// A raw Dart exception is not a message to a person standing at a car.

/// Found on a phone, 2026-08-20, connecting to a BLE peripheral that accepts a
/// GATT connection and then answers nothing. The screen said:
///
///     TimeoutException after 0:00:10.000000: Future not completed
///
/// That is `'$e'` reaching the user through `_failAttempt`. One branch away,
/// the handshake failure path says 「初始化未通過，轉接器可能不相容」 — a
/// sentence somebody can act on. The connect path had no equivalent, so every
/// exception that is not a `TransportException` arrived verbatim.
///
/// The technical string still matters — it is exactly what a maintainer wants
/// out of an exported transcript — so this is not about deleting it. It is
/// about which of the two audiences gets it.
