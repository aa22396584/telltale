/// The clear's two safety flags were left behind. So — codex, round 30 — tap
/// 清除, switch to the dashboard, come back, and a fresh widget state arrived
/// with the repeat-lock cleared and the warning gone, over codes that were
/// still on screen. The next tap sent a second global `04`, which reaches the
/// controller the first one just finished and resets its readiness monitors
/// again: another full drive cycle before the vehicle can pass an emissions
/// test.
///
/// These tests do not build a widget. They exercise the state a widget would
