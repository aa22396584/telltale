/// A recording that exists must not be labelled as if it were empty.

/// Found on a phone, 2026-08-20. A BLE connection to a peripheral that was not
/// an ELM327 failed at `ATZ`, and the connect screen said — correctly, and
/// usefully — 「這次嘗試的完整往返紀錄留著了。帶回來比一句訊息有用。」On the
/// next launch the same recording was offered as **0 KB**.
///
/// The arithmetic was right and the message was wrong. `bytes / 1024` rounded
/// to zero decimals reads 0 for anything under 512 bytes, and a failed
/// handshake is a few hundred bytes: the reset, the timeout, and the step it
/// died on. That is the most diagnostic recording this app produces — the ones
/// that connect successfully are long and boring — and it was the one shown as
/// nothing. Nobody exports a file the app has just told them is empty.
