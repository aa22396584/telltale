/// Fault-code scan results outlive a tab switch, and only a tab switch.

/// Fable found this on a device: scan the car, tap 性能, tap back, and the
/// screen says 尚未掃描. The results lived in `_DtcScreenState`, and the shell
/// is an ordinary `ShellRoute` driven by `context.go`, so changing tabs
/// disposes the screen. Ten seconds of scanning on a real car did not survive
/// a glance at the dashboard.
///
/// The obvious fix — hoist it into a provider — would have traded that for a
/// far worse bug, because the widget-local state was buying something real:
/// results could never outlive the connection that produced them. A verdict
/// about the car in front of you is not a verdict about the next one, and a
/// stale green "no fault codes" panel is the most dangerous thing this screen
/// can show. Both properties are asserted here.
