/// What a dial prints, and what it says out loud.

/// `_semanticValue`'s doc comment claimed it announced "at the same precision
/// the readout shows" and it carried its own copy of a different rule. A
/// lambda of 0.85 was printed as 0.8 and read aloud as 0.85 — two of this
/// app's users getting different numbers off one dial, which is the same
/// defect as two parts of a screen disagreeing, arriving in the place nobody
/// looks.
///
/// Asserted through a pumped widget rather than by comparing the formatter
/// with itself. A first version of this file did the latter, which is a
/// tautology: both sides now call one function, so of course they agree, and
/// the thing worth holding is that the *widget* uses it on both paths.
