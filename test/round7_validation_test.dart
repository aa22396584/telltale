/// What a PID definition may not be, whichever door it came in by.

/// Both findings were verified against Dart 3.13 directly rather than reasoned
/// about. `double.tryParse('NaN')` returns NaN; every comparison against NaN is
/// false, so `max <= min` waved it past. The dial's
/// `((value - min) / (max - min)).clamp(0, 1)` then evaluates to 1.0 — a needle
/// pinned at full scale and an arc fully lit, for an engine at idle. And
/// `jsonEncode` throws on a non-finite double, so saving wedges *and* leaves
/// the definition in memory, after which every later save of any custom PID
/// throws too.
///
/// The second is quieter. The validator's two callers each normalised the
/// identifier their own way before storing it, and `pidByte` reads
/// `substring(2, 4)` — which for a stored `01 0C` is `' 0'` and parses to null.
/// Type that into the editor and the gauge never reads anything, with nothing
/// on screen to say why, while the identical text imported from a spreadsheet
/// works.
