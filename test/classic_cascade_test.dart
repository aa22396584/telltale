/// The Bluetooth Classic fallback cascade, and when it stops.
///
/// This file exists because of how its subject went missing. The cascade's
/// abort was written, reviewed, described in a commit message and in two code
/// comments and one user-facing hint — and then reverted by a stray
/// `git checkout` of a not-yet-committed file during an unrelated mutation
/// check. Everything downstream stayed green, because nothing anywhere pinned
/// what the cascade does next. The commit landed describing behaviour it had
/// just deleted, and a reviewer found it by reading the code against the
/// message.
///
/// So the rules that matter here are the ones about what does *not* happen:
/// a tier that must not start, a note that must not be dropped.
