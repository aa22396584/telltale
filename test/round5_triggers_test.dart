/// Round 5 CRITICAL findings, each expressed as the bytes that trigger it.
///
/// Both reviewers supplied wire-level triggers rather than descriptions, so
/// every test here is the reviewer's own scenario rather than my reading of it.
/// That matters: the previous four rounds each fixed the defect I had
/// understood and left the one I had paraphrased.
///
/// Every test here was red before the fix. Getting them *honestly* red took
/// three attempts and is worth recording, because both failure modes appeared:
///
///   - **False green.** Asserting `isNull` passed while the readings map was
///     empty for an unrelated reason — the engine merges `physicsInputs` into
///     every poll set, so an ECU that answers only the PID under test produces
///     a short batch, trips the corruption handler, and never reaches it. That
///     is finding H5-1 masking the others; `_physicsReplies()` exists to stop
///     it. A test that passes because nothing happened proves nothing.
///   - **False red.** Several tests failed inside `connect()`, not in the code
///     under test, because the fake ECU had no `0100` for the handshake probe.
///     A test that is red for the wrong reason is worse than a green one: the
///     real fix leaves it red, which invites the fix to be "corrected" until
///     the colour comes back.
///
/// Where a trigger runs on a different bus than the reviewer described, the
/// comment says so and why. The mechanism, not the protocol, is the finding.
