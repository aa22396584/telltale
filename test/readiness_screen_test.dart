/// What the readiness card says, against what the decoder knows.
///
/// `readiness_test.dart` holds the decoder. This holds the screen — and the
/// gap between them is where round 36 found a false all-clear. `Readiness`
/// grew `unnamedSupported` / `unnamedOutstanding` so a monitor this table
/// cannot name could still block "ready", and `allSupportedComplete` was
/// written to honour that. The card never used it: it asked
/// `incomplete.isEmpty` — named monitors only — and told a driver with an
/// outstanding unnamed monitor that everything was finished.
///
/// The same shape as the gauge face two rounds ago. A rule moved somewhere
/// testable, and the call site kept its own older copy.
///
/// Every case here is built by `Readiness.decode` from bytes an ECU could
/// actually send, not by naming fields on the model. That matters more than
/// it looks: **only compression ignition has unnamed bits at all** — the petrol
/// map covers all eight of C's bits, so a `spark` readiness with
/// `unnamedSupported > 0` is a state the decoder cannot produce and a test
/// pinning it would be pinning fiction.
